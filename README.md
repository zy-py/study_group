Python Study Group for Eller MIS Students

Hi Eller MIS Pythonistas! Welcome to the zypy python study group repository! Here, you can make suggestions for python topics to cover and  find sample code to work with for our example sessions.

If you're new to python and/or GitHub, no problem! We're going to be addressing the key topics in our study group!
